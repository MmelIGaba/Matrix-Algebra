## What Is this program about
### Matrix Algebra - Basic Computations

The program will be on matrix algebra, specifically the Computations#
of the determinant, transpose, and the addition, subtraction and 
multiplication of two matrices.

#### Vision For the Program
##### What it does
1. The program must have two different 2-by-2 matrices A and B.
2. The must be functions to get the determinant (det()), transpose 
(tran()) and the inverse (inv()).
3. Addionally it must have addition (add()), subtraction (subtr()),
and multiplication (mult()).
4. More matrix algebra functions will be added as time goes on.
5. Must contain comments with relevant matrix identities and test to 
verify that these identities are observable with A and B.
